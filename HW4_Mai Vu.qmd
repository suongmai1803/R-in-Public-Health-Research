# Section 1
```{r}
# Select one numerical and one categorical variable in the data set imported in this notebook and generate a box-and-whisker plot that has not been created as example in this notebook.
dfr <- readr::read_csv("PlottingData.csv")
head(dfr)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dfr, aes(x = Diabetes, y = dBP, fill = Diabetes)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of dBP by Diabetes status",
       x = "Diabetes",
       y = "Diastolic Blood Pressure (dBP)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Section 2
```{r}
# Select two numerical variables and a categorical variable and create a scatter plot (grouped by the levels of the categorical variable) that has not been created as example in this notebook.
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dfr, aes(x = HB, y = HR, color = Obesity)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of HB vs HR grouped by Obesity",
       x = "Hemoglobin (HB)",
       y = "Heart Rate (HR)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Section 3
```{r}
# Look up what a mosaic plot is. Import an appropriate library and create a mosaic plot of the variables Ventilation and Obesity.
# A moasic plot is a graphical representation of categorical data that displays the proportions of different categories in a contingency table. It uses rectangles to represent the frequencies of combinations of categories, with the area of each rectangle proportional to the frequency of that combination.

# Create a mosaic plot of Ventilation and Obesity
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dfr, aes(x = Ventilation, fill = Obesity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Mosaic-style plot of Ventilation vs Obesity",
       x = "Ventilation", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_minimal()
