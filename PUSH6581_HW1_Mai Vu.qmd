Section 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

```{r}
# Calculate 3 * 4 + 7 - 8 / 13
3 * 4 + 7 - 8 / 13
```

```{r}
# Calculate e^-3
exp(-3)
```

```{r}
# Calculate 4th root of 100
100^(1/4)

```

```{r}
# Natural log of 15.8
log (15.8)
```

```{r}
# Calculate sin(pi/6)
sin(pi/6)
```

Section 2

```{r}
# The code produce the error becasue the 'Y' here is upper case where the 'y' that is equal to 2 is lower case so R does not recognize the character Y. That's why it's giving the "object 'Y' not found error
```

Section 3

```{r}
v<-seq(3,21,by=2)
v
```

Section 4

```{r}
lab_vector <- c(3, 6, 3.141592654, 3 + 4i)
lab_vector
3+4i
# The expression 3+4i produce a complex number in R. Becasue one element of the vector is complex, R coerces all the element in lab_vector to a complex number.
```

Section 5

```{r}
height<-rnorm(100, mean=172,sd=10)
height<-round(height, 1)
head(height)
```
